Installation notes:

yarn add graphql @apollo/server

yarn add @nestjs/common @nestjs/core reflect-metadata rxjs
yarn add @nestjs/platform-express

yarn add passport @nestjs/passport passport-jwt @nestjs/jwt passport-local bcrypt axios
yarn add @as-integrations/express5
yarn prisma:gen

copy generated into node_modules/@rs-tech-hub/nestjs-prisma/src/lib/generated/client

schema needs to be -js
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../generated/.prisma/client"
}

ISSUES:
- common-interceptors package needs to be re-published!!!
- generated prisma client gets removed when new packages are added!!
